This is a chorus plugin based on the Juno 60 chorus.

Button 1 is used for a more subtle chorus sound, while button 2 is used for a stronger chorus. The mix knob controls the amount of dry to wet signal the chorus applies, with the knob all the way to right the sound will be all chorus, with the mix knob all the way to the left, the sound will only be the dry signal, with no chorus applied.

## Downloading:

To download just the effect plugin, download the AuandVST3.zip file. Unzip, and put either the Vst3 or Au file in your plugins directory depending on your system.

## Sound Demo

The Sound demo is available to download and listen to as an .mp3 file.
The demo was recorded with a Gibson Les Paul Bridge pickup, straight into a Scarlet Solo interface, the first half of the sound demo is with no effects applied.
The next half of the demo is with the chorus applied with Button 1 and Mix at 60% (the default setting).
